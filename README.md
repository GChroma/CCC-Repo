# CCC-Repo
Completing Waterloo Canadian Computing Contest problems for practice

The python problems were completed when I first began coding just to learn how to code
The java problems were solved/attempted during practice for CCC 2021. Not all of the solutions work and some are pretty jank, but overall it wasn't half bad.

The folder and files for 2021 may be formatted differently as they were formatted as requested by waterloo.
